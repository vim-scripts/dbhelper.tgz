This script is an adaption of Dan York's (dyork at lodestar2.com) VIMRC file that acts as a helper in making docbook documents.  This script uses abbreviations in the form of ",<chracter>" to trigger automatic insertion of docbook tags.  I have added a few new abbreviations to the original exhaustive list from Dan York's original list.  I have further extended it to add compilation of the document from within VIM itself to generate the output in your most favourite format by using VIM's inbuilt "make" facility.    Please send your inputs and comments to vivekv at users.sourceforge.net
